# C Programming Exercises (FITech / LUT University)

This repository contains my solutions to the FITech / LUT University C programming course.  
The course focuses on learning the fundamentals of the C language and building a solid understanding of how low-level programming works.

## What this repository includes

The exercises cover a broad range of core C concepts, including:

- basic syntax, variables, data types and formatted input/output  
- control structures (if/else, loops, switch)  
- functions, modularity and simple libraries  
- working with text and binary files  
- arrays, matrices, structures (struct)  
- dynamic memory management (malloc, realloc, free)  
- linked lists implemented manually  
- small multi-file projects using headers and separate compilation  

The focus is on writing clear, self-contained programs that demonstrate understanding of memory, pointers, data structures and modular design in C.

## Building and running

All programs are written in standard C.  
You can compile any exercise with:

bash
gcc example.c -o example
./example
